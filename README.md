# LadyHacks Agenda

## Fork the Repo ([tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/))

## Collect relevant data about Philadelphia DA candidates for Tuesday's primary election

Have an idea for the type of data we should collect? Submit an issue!

Potential data we'll be gathering:
- party affiliation
- Wikipedia entries
- Picture (website)
- News Articles (Google)
- Office
    * Address
    * Contact
- Prosecution History
    * This is the hard part, the dataset that hasn't even been conceived of / published. Our brainstorming session last night includes:
        - LexisNexis/WestLawNex
        - Court Records
        - Bar Association
        - Crime Statistics (working backwards)
- Trend Visualizations
    * Optional

## Build an HTML, CSS, and JS page that displays the data

See the [tutorial](#installation) for how to get setup (below).

## Create visualizations based on trends in DA candidate data

Optional: [D3.js](https://d3js.org).
